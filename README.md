# gh_deployment_workflow

The goal of this project was to practice writing a simple GitHub Actions workflow to deploy a static website to GitHub Pages.

## Requirements

Write a GitHub action that deploys any changes made to the index.html file to GitHub Pages. It should only deploy the file when the index.html file is changed.

What I Did:

- Created a GitHub repository for the project called gh-deployment-workflow.
- Add a deploy.yml file in the .github/workflows directory which contains the GitHub Actions workflow to deploy the website to GitHub Pages.
- Ensured every push to the main branch that changes the index.html file triggers the workflow to run and deploy the website to GitHub Pages.
- Ensured the site was accessible at the GitHub pages URL for the repository e.g. https://dominicgerman.github.io/gh_deployment_workflow/.
